# cilinder
this is a simple program that illustrates some of the concepts introduced in paper 1 and paper 2 from the website www.pnf7.nl.\
the log.txt file is a redirect of some console in- and output of a single run.\
inputs:
the cilinder.txt file can be populated with data for different runs and configurations\
the flowfield.txt file has a key 'ffid' so that it can be used for multiple flowfields(running the same cilinder.exe with parameter ff1,ff2 etc.)\
cilinput.txt contains the search term for lkpadd\
input.txt is a temp file used by the program\
\
this folder is so simple so that it can be replicated using a 'Meta program'
